## Introduction :pushpin:
Reverse Image Search also known as Content based Image retrevial, This is the application of computer vision techniques to the image retrieval problem, that is, the problem of searching for images in large databases.

## Demo:

## 1. :thinking: Motivation[](#motivation)
Ever wondered how the [Google reverse image search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Images#Search_by_Image_feature) works, which take in an image and returns you the most similar images in a fraction of a second? 

Having a large database of images with no available metadata is not an ideal starting point, searching through those images can be exhausting to solve that we can use Image search engine, which will iterate through all the images and find all the similar images.

## 2. Dataset[](#dataset) :chart_with_upwards_trend:
To build search engine we need massive amount of data to seach on. For this image search engine I used [Caltech101](https://data.caltech.edu/records/20086) dataset.

This dataset contains 101 classes and there are about 40 to 800 images per category.
    

## 3. Model Weights[](#model-weights) :weight_lifting_woman:


| Model Name                                          | Weight size   | Weight Link
| -------------                                       | ------------- | --------

## 4. How to use it[](#how-to-use-it) :microscope: :test_tube: 
### Step 1: Clone the repo
- For new updates you can switch to dev branch.

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment
- [How to create virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

- Install all the required libraries using **requirements.txt** file.

### Step 3: Dataset download and extract filenames
- [Download the dataset](https://data.caltech.edu/records/20086) and add a absolute path in **dataset.py** file.
- Now Run dataset.py file

      python3 dataset.py
- A **pickle file** will be generated in a specified folder.
- We will use this pickel file in **model.py**

### Step 4: Install Model weights
- Install both [**Resnet finetuned model**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BQrPqh-CYey4vU0x3H4Ok5EX5WE-JV_K/view?usp=sharing) and [**feature list**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BR2x6kPLSRgrh1NMrd1wd7mJOccbqKmh/view?usp=sharing) from model weights.
- Add these weights and previously downloded pickle model in **model.py** file.

### Step 5: Search for the image
- Conform that you have added all necessary files.
- It's time to run the sreamlit webapp

       streamlit run app.py
- You will be redirected to new web page where you can search for any image in given dataset.
